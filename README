# flight-status-dashboard

Simple command line UI to view the status of your flight while in the air by pinging airlines' APIs (which are accessible even if you haven't paid for onboard Wi-Fi). 

I might turn this into a web page that stores and graphs stats about your flight as you go (ground speed, altitude, air temperature, etc.) and notifies you if your ETA changes because that sounds like fun.

Currently only supports United Airlines. Made while I was bored on a flight. Planning to support American Airlines soon.
