# flight-status-dashboard

Simple command line UI to view the status of your flight while in the air by pinging airlines' APIs (which are accessible even if you haven't paid for onboard Wi-Fi). 

Currently only supports United Airlines. Made while I was bored on a flight. Planning to support American Airlines soon.
